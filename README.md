Hi, I'm Carla! I'm a Software Engineer and Industrial Engineering Master's student. I'm highly interested in topics regarding backend engineering and DevOps. I'm currently working on implementing CI/CD pipelines, though on the side, I enjoy spending time developing projects related to personal finance.
