Hi, I'm Carla. I am currently a master's student at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez Campus, where I am pursuing graduate studies in Industrial Engineering. My areas of academic interest include forecasting, statistics, and operations research. I graduated last year with a bachelor's degree in Pure Mathematics and Economics minor.
